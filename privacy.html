<p>
Your privacy is critically important to us. We at DRDP have a few fundamental rules:
</p>
<ul>
<li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.</li>
<li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products and services, or protect our rights.</li>
<li>We treat your personal information with the highest regard to privacy and security.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following statement (the “Privacy Policy”) discloses the guidelines we have established for protecting the information you provide during your use of the app.</p>

<h3>What information about me does Service Reminder collect and how is it used?</h3>
<p>
Service reminder only collects personal information from the Strava service about you if you voluntarily choose to share it with Service Reminder. We use this data to provide the information in the app and for logging purposes. Service reminder does not share, rent or sell information concerning Service reminder users to third parties in ways other than disclosed in this privacy statement.
</p>
<p>
To use the core functionality of the app, you must first log in with Strava. This will allow the app to collect data needed for determining your service intervals. As with all Stava connected apps the Strava api allows personal information such as your name and email address to be seen by the app.
</p>
<p>
If you choose to log in with Strava, Service reminder may store your name and email and use it for internal research and other Service reminder marketing purposes, including e-mailing you with special promotions and other programs of interest.
</p>
<p>Service reminder uses Mixpanel as a method of tracking app statistics and user behavior in the app.
</p>
<p>
You may decide to send Service reminder personally identifying information in an e-mail message which might contain information or inquiries about Service reminder's products or services. Service reminder will use this information to identify you as a Service reminder member and to respond to the electronic mail. Service reminder will only use the information obtained to resolve the issue identified in the e-mail. Service reminder never sells e-mail addresses. You may change or request deletion of your personal information by contacting <a href="ucspier@gmail.com">ucspier@gmail.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
Service reminder will only share your personal information with third parties if:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Service reminder has your consent;
</li>
<li>
Service reminder determines that it is required to do so by law; such as in response to a court order or subpoena;
</li>
<li>
Service reminder finds that you are in breach of its terms and conditions or any of its policies or usage guidelines for specific products or services;
</li>
<li>
it is necessary in Service reminder's opinion to do so to prevent, investigate, detect or prosecute criminal offenses or attacks on the technical integrity of the app or Service reminder's network;
</li>
<li>
it is necessary in Service reminder's opinion to do so to protect the rights, property, or safety of Service reminder or its employees, the users of its app(s), or the public; or
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Information about you and your use of the app may be aggregated with other information collected on the app or otherwise used in ways that do not personally identify you or constitute personally identifiable information. This type of aggregated or statistical information may be used by us to improve the quality of the app or for other purposes that we may deem appropriate.
</p>

<h3>Privacy Policy changes</h3>
<p>
If Service reminder makes changes to any terms or conditions of this Privacy Policy, these changes will be posted here in a timely manner. If Service reminder decides to change this Privacy Policy, it will post those changes on this Privacy Policy and other places Service reminder deems appropriate, which may include this Site, for a period of time Service reminder deems appropriate, so that you are aware of what information Service reminder collects, how Service reminder uses it, and under what circumstances, if any, Service reminder discloses it. Service reminder reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently. In case of a business transaction in which a portion or all of Service reminder's business is acquired, Service reminder will notify you as described above in this paragraph.
</p>
<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p>
While Service reminder continues to work hard to protect your personal information, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be absolutely secure, and Service reminder cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Service reminder. Transmitting personal information is done at your own risk.
</p>
<h3>Contact Service reminder</h3>
<p>
Service reminder welcomes your questions and comments about security and privacy. Please send any questions or comments via email to <a href="ucspier@gmail.com">ucspier@gmail.com</a>.
